      <description>The old Upstream, was very large.. and very bloated (800 mb). Not anymore.

Here it is.. Upstream OS, version 6. Now with a download size of 590mb. Finally a smaller but still fully functional OS.

Now available in the form of ISO and WMware/VirtualBox/KVM.

That way if the user does install a particular app, the Upstream branding will be ready for it. All OpenSuse branding packages have been removed. So if your looking for a plain OS to start work on, this is the one.

Features:

The latest and most up-to-date KDE 4 repository. 
No-branding. 
Upstream-themed apps. 
Google Chrome. 
KMail. 
Flash preinstalled.

      <description>MiniSUSE comes with all the great packages you might need. It offers you a +Swiss army knife for all your Linux needs+ - still it is +small+ enough to fit a CD/DVD or USB drive. You can use it to rescue systems, format drives, check sensors or hack whatever you want. If you are looking for a small, but extremely useful Linux distribution you can +get up and running in seconds+ from the media of your choice, look no further :)

      <description>PLEASE NOTE: I HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF UNFIXABLE ERRORS UPDATING THIS TO  11.3 SO I`D LOVE SOME ONE TO SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT
Jinx is gnome based operating system. It is so big it needs a lot of DVD space, but it is worth it. Why?
Jinx is made for you, the user.

Please note I tried to scale it down on size to make a quicker download!

You can browse the web with one of the most reliable, most popular, and open source browser, Firefox. Firefox is a fast web browser that uses Gecko. Find more about it at http://mozilla.com/firefox

You can check emails easily with Thunderbird. This is made b y the same company as Firefox is, Mozilla. More about Thunderbird can be found at http://mozilla.com/thunderbird

Jinx also has Ktorrent. Ktorrent is a torrent client to download and upload torrent files.

Version 1.0.1 Release Notes/Change Log:
Newer Background For Boot Screen, Really Good Graphics on the background.
Added Ktorrent
Removed Evolution Because Thunderbird is the same thing
There is still a bug on the keyboard language chooser. Please help me out with it!!!
Also Comment on which games you want... they take up space so i took away all the games...
Download Them at http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGames/ or just get Jinx Gamer (At the site)


Cloning Jinx Shows Support. So Clone.
But if you publish your cloned version of Jinx, you have to follow the license:
view it at: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/
Basically You Can Do:
No Commercial Work With You Cloned Distro
You Can not say this is originally you own work, and give a link to Jinx's site
Your Cloned Distro Must Have The Same License</description>

      <description>bgta's Android developer desktop is a great idea, but there is a problem: it's filled with tons of cruft not needed for a developer's desktop like Tomboy, GIMP and Empathy, and added some useful things like a git GUI. I've drastically decreased the size of the appliance with these changes.

I try and improve on their appliance with this. Also, I've switched out the PAE kernel with the standard one, to help it run on more devices.</description>
